# mlass: Machine Learning clASS

Many machine learning algorithms' implementation are complicated for mixing algorithm itself with optimization algorithms. In this package, I try to implement some basic, pure machine learning algorithm without optimization.


# Algorithms

The following algorithms will be implemented:

	Linear Regression with one variable <2012-01-06, Fri>
